<p>This package contains various performance enhancements used in
the Idemix crypto lib.</p>

There are two methods implemented: fixed-base window and fixed-base comb
method.</p>

<p>Another module implements multi-core exponentiation to make use
of multi-core processors. And yet another class generates safe-primes
using a multi-core processor.</p>
